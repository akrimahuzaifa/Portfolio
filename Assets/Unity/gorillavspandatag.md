  My role: Software Developer

  Project description:
  **GORILLA VS PANDA TAG Mobile** is a Unity 3D Android game featuring two exciting modes: Hunter vs Runner and Bomb Tag. In Hunter vs Runner, players can choose to be either the hunter or runner, select a map, and then hunt gorillas to reduce the number of runnersâ€”or evade capture. In Bomb Tag, players start with a bomb and must pass it to the nearest gorilla before it explodes. The game also includes an AI dodging system where enemies avoid the player, and it's integrated with Google Ads for monetization.
